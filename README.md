Jaisal Friedman, Mikolaj Debicki, Andriy Lunin

## Data source
We are using The COVID Tracking dataset published by [the Atlantic] (https://covidtracking.com/). All credits to them for collecting great data.

## Published Data
We are publishing two small but potentially useful data-sets.
1. State-by-state start dates of stay-at-home orders [Source: NYTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html)
[data/state_lockdown_start_date.csv](data/state_lockdown_start_date.csvv)
2. State-by-state day of 100th case. We computed this using the COVID Tracking dataset listed above.
[data/states_100th_case_date.csv](data/states_100th_case_date.csv)
