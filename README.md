Jaisal Friedman, Mikolaj Debicki, Andriy Lunin

## Data sources
We are primarily using The COVID Tracking dataset published by [the Atlantic] (https://covidtracking.com/). All credits to them for collecting great data.
Below is the full-list of data sources: 
1. [U.S. State by State Testing Data] (https://covidtracking.com/api)
2. [U.S. State by State Population Data 2019] (https://api.census.gov/data/2019/pep/population?get=POP&for=us:)
3. [U.S. State Stay-at-Home Orders Dataes] (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html)

## Published Data
We are publishing two small but potentially useful data-sets.
1. [State-by-state start dates of stay-at-home orders](data/state_lockdown_start_date.csv) [Source: NYTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html)
- [data]
2. [State-by-state day of 100th case](data/states_100th_case_date.csv) We computed this using the COVID Tracking dataset listed above.
